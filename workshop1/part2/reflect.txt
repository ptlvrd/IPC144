Authenticity Declaration:

I declare this submission is the result of my own work and has not been
shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider. This submitted
piece of work is entirely of my own creation.

Answers:
1. yes, i have previous programming experience in java langauge and c language.
 i learned basic programming in java for example strigs, expressions, functions and others at my high school.
i learnd programming using c language online where i completed online free courses at codeacademy website and cisco.

2.When a compiler receives a set of instructions as input, a set of machine language instructions is created. 
Source code is the name for the compiler's input, whereas binary code is the compiler's output. 
Then tell the operating system to put the binary code into RAM and start running that code so as 
to start the programme we wrote. Our program's user inputs data while the code is running and gets output from it.

3.i hope to improve on my programming and coding skills to the best of my ability which could promote
 into my future goal to be a software engineer.
