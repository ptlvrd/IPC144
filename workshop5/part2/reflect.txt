 answer 1
one of advantage is that it improves the code readability and hence can be understandable. 
secondly, it saves us from writing a value which can be very complicated and lengthy which some 
times is time consuminy as writing it for number of times used in the code.
thirdly, they are easy to search and replace in the code before it is build.

answer 2 
we do not include additional logic that sums and performs the average because if the
additional logic to sum and calculate the average of the data was included throughout
the iteration phase, it would be more difficult to understand and maintain the code. 
In this case, the iteration's objective is to perform fundamental checks to ensure that the 
values given by the user are within the acceptable range. secondly, If more logic were 
added to sum and determine the average, it would be more difficult to comprehend the code,
especially if the iteration is already doing other validations.
Instead, the sum and average logic is placed outside of any validation routine because by
separating the calculation and validation logic, the code becomes more modular and easier to understand.
When each block is dedicated to a single action, code maintenance and testing are made easier. secondly,
Without having to worry about the effects of any validation problems, testing the mathematical logic 
and making sure its accuracy is much easier.
