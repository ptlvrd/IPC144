answer1
there are three types of iteration constructs a for loop, while loop and do-while loop. 
although it is true that we can make any one of them behave the same way but they 
each have unique structures and were created with certain purposes in mind. when working with arrays,
i prefer do-while loop and mostly it is favored because it ensures that the body of the loop 
will be run at least once. This can be helpful for checking user input or when we want to take
action on all of the array's elements, starting with the first one. A do-while loop enables us 
to handle the initial element of an array and then iterate over the other items of the array as 
needed because the number of elements in an array might vary.

to find where the problem was located,while testing, i first created a test plan about how the program should
work and what outputs it should give, then i tested each statements and function of the program to 
make sure if they work as expected, later i re ran the program as whole and i found it to work as expected.
while debugging, The compiler or interpreter will frequently give error messages(shows red lines) if there are
syntax mistakes, describing where and what kind of error there is.also, i always ask my friend to check my code for 
any logical mistakes that i might have done.

answer3
i will first open the files w6p2_master_output.txt which has correct output and output.txt which has my ouput
then to find differences i will comapre the content of both files and mostly pay attention to  line number 6,
which is where the error feedback says the error.also,i comapred the character in column 33, The character should
have been "[0]" with an ASCII code of 48, but i printed "[5]" with an ASCII code of 53, according to the error
feedback. later i will match the values of both files, the incorrect response indicates that while i should have 
entered "Enter your monthly NET income: $0," i instead entered "Enter your monthly NET income: $567.89." so here 
the error was of inputing the values, so i re run the code and entered the correct values as intended which led to
creating a new output file hence the outputs matched, and i can now submit my work successfully.
