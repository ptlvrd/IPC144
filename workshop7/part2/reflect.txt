answer-1
i was successful in coding non-repetitive sections of logic in the game
play portion of this workshop because i first analyzed the code and understood
and wrote it down into small parts. i identified the common areas the repetitive
sections and extracted them into functions. i then identified the loops i need
that are needed to use to perform multiple times. i used arrays to store and 
manipulate data because it helped me reduce reppetive code by appyling operatins 
to whole code instead of each element.

Structures offer a means of bringing together various variables that are connected
to one another. we may isolate the variables into a structure to handle and analyse 
the data more effectively than dealing with separate variables distributed across the code.
we may improve the structure of the code by grouping relevant data into structures. 
By defining the structure only once and utilising it throughout the program, we may
cut down on the number of unnecessary variable declarations. the code becomes clearer
and simpler to understand as a result.

 do{
     for (y = 0; y < game.pathLength; y++) 
       {
         if (recentPosition[y] == 'V') 
            {
                count++;
            }
       }
    }
 i have an outer do while loop that contains a nested for loop. 
 Inside that loop, there is a nested if statement.This outline demonstrates
 three levels of nesting.
